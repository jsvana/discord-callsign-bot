# This requires a QRZ.com XML subscription: https://www.qrz.com/i/subscriptions.html
# QRZ credentials are shared across all servers

# Guild (Server) Configurations
# ============================================================================
# Each [[guilds]] entry represents one Discord server to monitor
# You can add multiple [[guilds]] sections to monitor multiple servers!
# Each server gets its own output file and can have custom settings

# First Server Configuration
[[guilds]]
# The Guild (Server) ID where you want to read members from
# To get this: Enable Developer Mode in Discord settings, right-click the server, "Copy Server ID"
guild_id = 1234567890123456789

# Optional: Set a nickname for the bot when it joins this server
# If not specified, the bot will use its default username
bot_nickname = "B0T"

# Output Configuration for this server
[guilds.output]
# Path to the output text file for this server
file_path = "members.txt"

# Default text to append after each member entry
# This will be used unless overridden for specific users
default_suffix = "73"

# Emoji to place between callsign and name
# Examples: "📻", "✨", "|", or just " " for a space
# Default is "📻" if not specified
emoji_separator = "🌊"

# Optional: Title to display at the start of the output file
# Will be formatted as "# TITLE: <your title>"
# If not specified, no title line will be added
title = "Club members"

# Manual Overrides for this server
# Use Discord User IDs as keys (enable Developer Mode, right-click user, "Copy User ID")
# You can override the callsign, name, and/or suffix for specific users
# NOTE: Overrides are per-server, so the same user can have different settings on different servers!

# Example: Override everything for a specific user
[guilds.overrides."123456789012345678"]
callsign = "W1ABC"
name = "John"
suffix = "CQ CQ"

# Example: Only override the callsign, keep parsed name
[guilds.overrides."234567890123456789"]
callsign = "K2DEF"

# Example: Only override the suffix text
[guilds.overrides."345678901234567890"]
suffix = "QRT"

# Example: Override name and suffix, keep parsed callsign
[guilds.overrides."456789012345678901"]
name = "Alice"
suffix = "DX"

# Example: Override emoji separator for a specific user
[guilds.overrides."567890123456789012"]
emoji = "✨"

# ============================================================================
# Second Server Configuration (Example)
# ============================================================================
# Uncomment this section to monitor a second Discord server

# [[guilds]]
# guild_id = 9876543210987654321
# bot_nickname = "RadioBot"
#
# [guilds.output]
# file_path = "server2-members.txt"
# default_suffix = "CQ"
# emoji_separator = "📻"
# title = "Second Server Members"
#
# # This server can have its own overrides
# [guilds.overrides."123456789012345678"]
# # Same user, different callsign on this server!
# callsign = "N2XYZ"
# name = "Johnny"
# suffix = "DX operator"

# ============================================================================
# Third Server Configuration (Example)
# ============================================================================
# You can add as many servers as you want!

# [[guilds]]
# guild_id = 1111222233334444555
# bot_nickname = "HamBot"
#
# [guilds.output]
# file_path = "pota-members.txt"
# default_suffix = "POTA hunter"
# emoji_separator = "🏞️"
# title = "POTA Activation Group"
